# saurav006-Craiglist_Ads_Classification

This GitHub repository hosts the models developed for improving Craigslist's accuracy and user satisfaction by addressing misclassified computer-related postings. The project employs advanced NLP techniques and LSTM neural networks to analyze and classify computer-related listings, reducing misclassification rates and enhancing user experience. Data scraping and labeling from the Chicago and San Francisco sections provided the necessary dataset. Multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, XGBoost, and LSTM, were trained and compared, with LSTM showing the best results. The repository includes detailed documentation on the models used, the data preprocessing steps, and instructions on how to set up and run the classification models.
